## How to play

Every ten seconds, a voting round ends. During each round, an author may cast a vote for the next word in the novel. However, the author has a limited pool of words, to be expanded by the top contributors. If the author's votes are consistently being selected for the novel, he/she will be able to add new words to the vocabulary.
